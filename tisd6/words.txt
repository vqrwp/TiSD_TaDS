Recent advances in genetic biology have led us to 
quite a doubtful situation. People all over the 
world argue whether human cloning research should 
be controlled by the government as solving problems 
connected with human cloning is definitely not a 
piece of cake. In my opinion, human cloning experiments 
are extremely dangerous because there are huge risks 
of abnormalities in human clones. Moreover, if clones 
have been made, they will obviously have serious 
psychological problems connected with their unusual 
birth. Finally, human there is no doubt that human cloning
will change our perception of what is the value of a 
human life as we might change from having children 
to manufacturing them. However, scientists claim that 
human cloning could be very beneficial as therapeutic 
cloning could provide stem cells for regenerative 
medicine and tissues for transplantation. Besides, 
re-productive cloning will probably give parents who 
are both infertile an opportunity to have children. 
I am afraid that this technology is not safe enough 
to use on humans. It is also possible that clones
will age quicker since the cell used in the cloning 
procedure has already been used in a real life individual.
